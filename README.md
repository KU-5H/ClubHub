<h4>ClubHub is a platform designed to streamline club and group management, making it easier to handle finances, payments, and communications. With ClubHub, you can effortlessly track finances, send reminders, and create announcements for users.</h4>

Typically, clubs or groups are required to mix and match services to help manage a club, so we designed an all in one service that eliminates the need for other club management services. 

Clubhub also boasts some unique benefits over mix and matching services, including: 
- An entire role based system, which changes the website based on the role of the user. Role include the: **```Coach```**/**```Treasurer```**/**```Member```**
- The ability to pay on the site itself, with the **```Treasurer```** being able to view all revenue/profit that the club generates
- A full calender system so the **```Coach```** can make events or meetups for the clubs, which every member can see
- Full fledged Register/Login system for users
- A communication system where users can talk to one another
- And More! Discussed in the [![Features](https://img.shields.io/badge/Features/Roadmap-green)](https://github.com/KU-5H/ClubHub/blob/main/README.md#features-) section.

It's important to note Clubhub is still in development, thus the site and all it's features are not yet fully implemented. You can view the progress made so far in the [![Features](https://img.shields.io/badge/Features/Roadmap-green)](https://github.com/KU-5H/ClubHub/blob/main/README.md#features-) section. 

Additionally, you can view out demo video for the site here: [![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-cyan)](https://github.com/KU-5H/ClubHub/blob/main/README.md#demo-video-)

### Frontend
[![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](https://react.dev/)
[![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/vite-%23646CFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vite&logoColor=white)](https://vitejs.dev/)

- Used to create custom roles (**```Coach```** / **```Treasurer```** / **```Member```**), assign different web pages based on the role of the user, and provide visuals that the viewer can see
- React and Tailwind primarily make up what the user can see on the webpage


### Backend
[![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)](https://developer.mozill)
[![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](https://expressjs.com/)
[![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)](https://www.mongodb.com/)
[![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en)

- The backend is used to make API calls and requests to the database

## Installation [![Installation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Installation-purple)](https://github.com/KU-5H/ClubHub?tab=readme-ov-file#Installation)

### Basic Essentials
[![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://git-scm.com/)
[![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Starting Installation / Frontend Setup:
[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](https://react.dev/)
[![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/vite-%23646CFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vite&logoColor=white)](https://vitejs.dev/)
1. Clone the repo with ```git clone```:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KU-5H/ClubHub.git
   ``` 
2. Install NPM packages on both the frontend and backend folder:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Run the frontend with ```npm run dev``` (You have to be in the frontend folder), which will run on ```http://localhost:5173/```, though it won't work without the backend set up.

### For the backend:
[![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](https://expressjs.com/)
1. Make a ```.env``` file in your backend. In here you will store ```PORT=5000```, your ```MONGOURL``` (more details in database setup) and ```JWT_SECRET``` which can just be a random set of characters/numbers.
2. Run the backend with ```npm start``` (You have to be in the backend folder). 
The backend will then run on ```http://localhost:5000/```t though you will need a database for this to work.

### Database Setup:
[![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Since MongoDB Atlas requires permission to access the database, you won't be able to run this branch without being a member of the database. So first get permission to join the database or use your own to host. This installation assumes you either are a member of the database or will be using your own database.
- Connect to the Database using the link provided and set it to ```MONGOURL```. Make sure you add yourself in database access in the MongoDB site

#### At this point the application will run on your local system
